.hpp is also a head file.
(header ++)

.cpp files always compiled.

hungarian notation:
bool bTest = 5;

first letter of type at start of variable name, and camelcase

n_varaible for class vars. bool n_bfunction for hungarian.

can set char by going one letter at a time.





----- pointers -----
char arrays are already pointers so don't need &:

char test[] = "test";
char* test2 = test;
cout << test2[1];

also works for offsetting the array:

char test[] = "test";
char* test2 = &test[1];
cout << test2[1];

or just do

char test[] = "test";
char* test2 = test;
test2 += 1;
cout << test2[1];

Pointers created on the heap instead of the stack. (new keyword)

set a pointer to "nullptr" which just equals 0. RAM address 0 is only used for null ptrs.

can either make a function accept a reference, and just put the variable in the arguments, or you can make a function accept a pointer, then pass a reference into the function.
