union
{
	int a;
	int b;
};

All variables in the union point to the same memory address.
Don't need to keep the types the same, but it wont convert the types like with a cast.

	struct RGB
	{
		unsigned char r;
		unsigned char g;
		unsigned char b;
		unsigned char a;
	}

union
{
	unsigned int colour;

	RGB colorRGB;
}
