- Unified Modelling Language (UML)

- In most programs we will use more than one class, these work together to achieve a result.
- THis works by sending messages to other functions, or calling the functions of other classes.

- Two types of diagrams:
	- Collaboration diagrams
		- Shows how one class/ object might interact with another.
		- Pretty much class diagram.
	- Sequence diagrams
		- Shows what happens over time.
		- Shows sequence/ timeline of messages between classes.
		- Set up similar to a callstack.
		- Called left to right (messages passed)
		- Returns go from right to left)
		- All goes from top to bottom until main program return.

- Cmesh can be used with these diagrams, which is just a box showing the the class fuctions and vars.
+ meaning public and - meaning private.
