void pointers: can point to anything.
can't do 
void* test = new void;
this works:
- cant set a void pointer to any other pointer.
- Gives a way to pass anything into a function.
- Need to cast type to use properly.
- CAn be used to allocated all memory needed with
void* base_memory = malloc(40000000);
void* Graphics_Memory = (char*)base_memory
int Graphics_size = 10000000
void* Sound_Memory = (char*)base_memory + (char*)Graphics_size;
int Graphics_size = 30000000;
