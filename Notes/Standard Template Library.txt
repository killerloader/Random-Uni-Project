- Not used as much in games industry due to being bloated, and sometimes can be done better. (slightly slower)
- Debatable whether to use.
- many other containers than vectors.
- List:
	- A series of nodes that are connected to each other.
- Vector:
	- An array that resizes themselves.
- Hash map, unordered map, queue, stack, dequeue, list, vector.
- Using insert with a vector is hard to do with a for loop, so it is recommended to use:
there is an iterator class in the stl.
std::iterator<>

vector<int>::iterator iter;
for(iter = myVar.begin(); iter != myVar.end(); iter++)
{
	cout << *iter << endl;
}

(Less important with a vector, however is needed with other types, like the list type)

myVar.insert(myVar.begin()+5, 54);

STL algorithms:
- Does things like sorting stl containers.
