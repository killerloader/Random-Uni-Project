ios_base::out is the command argument for output files. (Asks for write permission)
ios_base::in for read
ios_base::_Nocreate will not create a new file if it doesnt exist
ios_base::binary();
ios_base::app - write to end of file instead of clearing file.

must call file.close() at end. Can lock file after close?
| to pass more than one ios_base.
use is_open to check success.
same as console, using >> will read to a space, .getline will get the whole line.

seekg moves by characters.
