Point to first byte of function.
Can swap what function a function ptr points to to change behaviour.
can use a typedef to make it a lot simpler to create a function ptr.
typedef int (*MathFunction)(int, int);
MathFunction FuncPtr = nullptr;

not common in c++ becasue most things can be done with classes/ inheritence etc.
Another way to do things, flexibly.

c++ approach:

typedef int (Player::*MathFunction)(int, int);// (Even though is in header, must be in class)
