- Can't index like an array ([2]) you only have the start, the end and the legnth, then you loop through them all.
- node_ptr = node_ptr->next (used with iteration)
- New nodes can be created by nodes on the heap.
- Designed to be added to and removed from easily.
- Everything takes up more memory (downside)
- Singly linked only goes forward, double linked goes forward and backward (has a next and previous per node)
- A node is an item in the list which holds data, and the next and prev pointer.
- Don't hold in an array, pretty much makes it have no point.
