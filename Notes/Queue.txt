- Run using FIFO concept.
- First object pushed onto the queue is the first one out.
- Like stacks, we can only push and pop an object on and off the queue from a specific place.
(Can only pop first, and only push onto last)
- Only have to access the top element (first one added)
- You can not iterate or access any other elements.
- New objects added onto the end.
- Can be a singly linked list.

Operations: (Similar to stack)
- Empty, Size, Push, Pop (removes the frtont element (dequeue), Top

Usually implemented using linked lists, as we have to add and remove from different ends, which would require resizing or shifting in an array.
- Easy to remove the head element from a linked list than from other forms of basic data structure.

A deque is a double-ended queue, which allows items to be inserted and removed from both sides.

- Can be used to find plindrome (words that are the same backswards and forwards) by checking if what comes out on both sides is the same.
(when you reach a single letter then it is a plindrome)

- Good for scheduling algorithms (messages in online games etc)

- Deque has:
- PushBack, PopBack, PushFront, PopFront.
- Doubly linked list.

- Better than vectors because we don't need to move and copy items.

- Basically when we need to operatate on items in the order they were inserted in.


Dequeue: Removing from the end.
Deque: Double ended queue (pronounced as deck, oterwise would sound same as dequeue)

- Node can be inside queue class.
