- Finding elements or an element that match a set of properties.
- Linear search: Just iterate through array.

- Binary search:
	- only works if sorted.
	- Split the data in two and check if it would be on both halves.
	- Keep splitting data and checking middle value until found, if min and max are the same and it is not found, then it does not exist.
	- DOuble size of array and you only need one more check, 16 checks with 60k items.

- If you were searching for if an enemy was alive, you could use a second array that points to the alive ones (not really binary)
