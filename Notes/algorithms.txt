BIg O Notation - system of explaining the worst case speed of an algorithm.
O(1):
	- Indexing an array: cour << Test[0];//Only one element though.
O(n):
	- Searching through an array for a value (worst case will go through whole array)
O(N^2):
	- Checking if any char in the first array is also in the second array (requires two for loops nested)
O(2^n)
	- 
O(Log(n))
	- Gets better as n increases (in comparison to others), binary search is an example.

Binary search:
	With a sorted array, you can check both halves and find which half a number would lie in, and you can continue halving the array until it is found.

Measure of how an algorithm scales.
