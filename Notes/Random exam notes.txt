THe size of a struct wont actually be the sum of the ints in the struct. FOr performance.
structs get 4 byte aligned.
Two chars next to each other wont use 8 bytes, they will both fit into a 2 byte slot.
but one char and one int will use 8 bytes, as an int can't start directly after.
chars among ints will be given a 4 bytes slot.

Can find size of stack array, but not heap array.
