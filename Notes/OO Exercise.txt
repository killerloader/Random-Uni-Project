- Stone
- Plant
	- Tree
	- Grass
- Animal
	- Rabbit
	- Predator 
		- Fox

I might add 'Object' at the very base for everything to inherit from.
And i might add prey for the rabit to inherit from.

'Object' would have a position and a sprite.
'Animal' would have a name an animation, health and a movement function.
'Predator' may have which animals it would attack, and it's damage.
